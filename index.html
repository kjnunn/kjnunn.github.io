                        <h4>The way we cook, eat, buy and store our food is undergoing radical change.</h4>
                        <p>Emerging technologies, from the Internet of Things to augmented reality, present us with
                            endless possibilities to improve the way we produce and cook our food. But without good
                            design, these will only ever be possibilities. To bring this technology into the home’s –
                            and the hands – of everyday people, it has to be tailored into people-centred products and
                            services.</p>

                        <p>And that’s where Designit comes in.</p>

                        <h4>How might we introduce alternative foods such as insects into the Western diet – to eat and
                            to grow?</h4>
                        <p>The concept of eating insects isn’t new at all. On a global scale, these protein-packed bad
                            boys have been an important part of the diet for millennia. Really, Western cultures are
                            just late to adopt this food trend.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"It’s about a potential new Western culture of insect eating and breeding. … There is
                                a great variety of food on our planet that we rarely consider."</p>

                        <p>But they’re not just good for you, they’re good for the environment. The amount of red meat
                            we consume in the west is an ‘environmental nightmare’, and as population increases, it’s
                            simply unsustainable. Eating insects isn’t so much a trend, as a necessity. The opportunity
                            lies in making insects socially acceptable in the West, to eat and to grow.</p>

                        <h2>Bringing data to life</h2>
                        <hr class="star-primary">

                        <h3>‘Det Byggede Danmark’ transforms raw data into the fascinating stories of the built
                            environment.</h3>

                        <h4>Hidden in plain sight</h4>
                        <p>The Danes are famous for their high quality of life, and central to that standard of living
                            is the built environment. It’s one of the biggest contributors to the Danish gross domestic
                            product but, on an individual level, the built environment is so much more than that. It
                            forms the homes, public spaces, roads and underground infrastructure that make up the
                            framework of the nation. Furthermore, it contributes to the jobs, cultural heritage and even
                            identity of more than 5.5 million Danes. It’s all too easy to take this for granted, so
                            that’s why The Knowledge Centre for Housing Economics (BVC) wanted to get Danes thinking
                            more about the vital role the built environment plays in their lives.</p>

                        <h4>Numbers don’t always speak for themselves</h4>
                        <p>The BVC has been collecting and analysing statistics on the built environment since 2008, but
                            had challenges in communicating so much data to the public in an accessible and appealing
                            way. Designit was tasked with curating this wealth of information into a series of magazines
                            that would inform and inspire Danes. Together the team went through the BVC’s statistics,
                            shaping the raw data into stories that could contextualise and humanise the numbers.</p>

                        <p>Engaging and comprehensive, ‘Det Byggede Danmark’ combines different perspectives – from
                            personal interviews, to infographics and statistics, poetry, pictures, and technical
                            articles – to put the spotlight on the hidden stories of the Danish built environment.
                            Crucial to the magazines’ success is the distinct visual language created by the design
                            team. Uniquely, the visuals provide more than just ‘decoration’, but play a central role in
                            telling these stories. Traditional graphs are joined by innovative and striking visual
                            representations of data, while even the smallest details play their part in communicating
                            information, from typography to textures. With such a unique blend of visual storytelling
                            and careful content curation, the team has succeeded in bringing the Danish built
                            environment to life, and opening it up to a whole new audience.</p>

                        <p>‘Det Byggede Danmark’ was recently awarded an iF Design Award.</p>

                        <h2>The changing landscape of service design</h2>
                        <hr class="star-primary">

                        <p>Forrester Research has released its ‘Vendor Landscape: Service Design Agency Overview, 2015’.
                            The key trends? The service design industry has changed dramatically in just two years, and
                            Designit is one of the agencies included in the report.</p>

                        <h3>Service design is in flux</h3>
                        <p>Including a survey fielded to 70 service design agencies, this year’s Forrester ‘Service
                            Design Agency Overview’ reveals a dramatic shift in the industry. Just two years ago,
                            smaller agencies dominated the industry from Europe. Today, a more varied profile is
                            emerging. Through a series of agency mergers and acquisitions, the service design industry
                            has grown in recent years. Now these larger firms are changing the service design game as
                            full-service digital and business systems providers.</p>

                        <h3>Five flavours of service design</h3>
                        <p>So what exactly does it mean to be ‘full-service’? Well, based on the self-reported channels
                            and capabilities, the Forrester report identifies five ‘flavours’ of service design that
                            agencies mash up in different ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>‘Fuzzy front-end’ innovation</li>
                            <li>Physical and face-to-face experience design</li>
                            <li>Digital experience design</li>
                            <li>Organisational change partners</li>
                            <li>Business process consulting</li>
                        </ol>


                        <p>Most agencies practice two or three of these flavours, but there is a small group – including
                            Designit – that matched four or all five of these patterns. These fifteen agencies mark a
                            definitive move away from the previous pattern of specialised agencies and are leading the
                            way into a truly holistic end-to-end experience, from front-end to back of house.</p>
                        <p>Even so, service design is far from a homogenous discipline, and agencies mix and match these
                            five offerings in different ways. Here’s a quick look at some of the patterns we found most
                            interesting here at Designit, from big shifts, to hints at trends to come:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The biggest group by far was digital experience design. These are firms that combine
                                business strategy with specific design for web, mobile, and tablets. Nearly two thirds
                                of the agencies that responded to the Forrester survey fall into this group – and we can
                                only expect to see this number increase.
                            </li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, as service migrates to digital, the ‘canonical’ branch of service design,
                                i.e.: dealing with physical and face-to-face experiences, is much smaller. This year,
                                fewer than a third of the respondents match this pattern.
                            </li>
                            <li>Overall, business process consulting is the least-matched pattern, but Designit and the
                                other full-service agencies hint at a new trend, with eleven of these fifteen agencies
                                matching this pattern. Indeed, again unlike the other agencies, the report shows that
                                firms in the group with Designit are just as likely to think in terms of business
                                strategy as experience strategy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Another interesting emerging micro-trend – and another interesting exception – is a move
                            across the pond. Shifting from the European model, nine of the fifteen large, full-service
                            agencies have their headquarters in North America, with eight in the US alone.</p>

                        <h3>Our biggest takeaway? It’s all digital, baby.</h3>
                        <p>To say digital’s been growing for years is, itself, pretty much the understatement of the
                            year. But by now it’s really no surprise to see the vendor landscape and offerings reflect
                            that – for sure, design for web, mobile, and tablet are all key offerings at Designit.
                            Service design as a discipline is channel-agnostic, but as more of the customer’s experience
                            becomes digital, it’s only natural that service design, too, becomes increasingly digital.
                            And with more control over the experience, for both brand and user, digital can make it
                            easier to provide better, user-centred service experiences.</p>

                        <p>And as service migrates to digital, demand for physical and face-to-face service design
                            naturally falls. We won’t see the extinction of old school any time soon, though. Physical
                            remains an essential part of the service experience in many industries, from retail to
                            healthcare.</p>

                        <p>At Designit, newly partnered with Wipro Digital, we believe we are leading the way into 2016
                            with our own full-service offering.</p>

                        <h2>The media's current obsession with celebrity - good or bad?</h2>
                        <hr class="star-primary">
                        <p>Current obsession? Celebrity worship has been around for millennia. Gladiators were the rock
                            stars of the Roman world- the people of Pompeii didn’t need social media to obsess over
                            celebrities, graffiti did the trick: ‘Celadus the Thracian gladiator is the delight of all
                            the girls’. Gladiators were even known to give celebrity product endorsements.</p>

                        <p>So an obsession with celebrities is hardly a new thing, but then again it hardly goes to
                            prove that it’s a good thing. Besides, a Youtube video can spread faster and wider than any
                            graffito. This age of connectivity has encouraged more and more trivial 'news'- the kind of
                            information only stalkers used to know (...not that I was a stalker). It’s as if the more
                            we’re able to know, the more we want to know.</p>

                        <p>And this had opened a great big can of worms.</p>

                        <p>Many have an obsession with celebrity, but a few have an obsession with being a celebrity.
                            This deluge of information has made them want it, and allowed them to get it. So now it’s a
                            lose-lose situation. We’re invading the privacy of the well-balanced celebrities, and
                            enabling the narcissism of the rest. Is this level of information healthy for either of us?
                            It just feels so vacuous- couldn't our thirst for knowledge be better sated on current
                            events? (Or Romans… whatever.) Is the media even going so far as to ‘distract’ us with
                            celebrity gossip? I’ve heard accusations that the American media has been ignoring the
                            Ukrainian riots in favour of the arrest of Justin Bieber. Call me paranoid, but discontent
                            has been festering since the NSA and Snowden scandals… Well, the Roman senators always knew
                            how to put on a big show, at any rate.</p>
