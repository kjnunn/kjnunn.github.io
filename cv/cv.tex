\section{SUMMARY}
After graduating from Girton College, Cambridge, I moved to Copenhagen to pursue my career in copywriting. With experience ranging from a small startup company, to large international agency setting, I currently work as Global Copywriter at Designit, one of the world’s leading strategic design firms.

I’m passionate about writing clear, simple and effective copy, centred around users’ needs.
