\section{SUMMARY}
I’m a recent graduate from Girton College, Cambridge, where I read Classics. During my time there, I took up rowing and was part of Girton’s most successful women’s crew in ten years. In my final year, I was elected Chief Editor of the Classics Society newspaper, revolutionised communications for the boat club and graduated with a 2:1. I moved to Copenhagen last year to join a startup app company as Marketing Strategist and UK Account Manager. I’m an energetic, motivated self-starter, used to producing high-quality work under pressure and to tight deadlines.
