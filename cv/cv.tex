\section{SUMMARY}

I'm a recent graduate from Girton College, Cambridge, where I read Classics. During my time there, I took up rowing and was part of Girton's most successful women's crew in ten years. In my final year, I was elected Chief Editor of the Classics Society newspaper, captained the lower men's boat and managed to graduate with a 2:1 (and some sanity!). Now I'm hoping to start a career in copy writing and communications. I am an energetic, creative individual, used to producing high-quality work under pressure and to tight deadlines... and I make a great cappuccino!
