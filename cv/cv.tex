\section{SUMMARY}
Cambridge Classicist turned professional word-nerd, currently working in Global Marketing and Communications with one of the world's leading strategic \mbox{design} firms. 

I graduated from Girton College, Cambridge with a 2:1 in 2014, and have since had experience in an international agency, and a Danish startup app company. I’m an energetic, motivated self-starter, used to producing high-quality work under pressure and to tight deadlines.
