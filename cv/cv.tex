\section{SUMMARY}
Cambridge Classicist turned professional word-nerd, currently working as a copywriter with one of the world's leading strategic \mbox{design} agencies.

I graduated from Girton College, Cambridge in 2014, and have since had experience ranging from a small startup company, to large international agency setting. I firmly believe the secret to any good writing is all about understanding your reader, and I'm on a vendetta against incomprehensible jargon.
